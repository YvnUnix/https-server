# HTTPS server 

This is a personal project that I build during my free time for fun. 
A simple https-server built in C, containerized to run in Podman. I installed Fedora CoreOS to run the 
Podman container on the Raspberry Pi, which in turn runs my small website. This, of course, 
is a hobby project for fun and in no way meant for production."
